This Program has been written exclusively by Arasay Perez and Muhammad Siddiqui.

The Goal of this Program is to reach From one point to the goal point as specified by the user. 
The program then runs a Deapth First Search and choses only the neighbors that lead to the path starting from the lowest Valued neighbor

To run the program follow these steps:

1-Download the zip file AI_P2.zip, which contains my cpp file and readmefile

2-Open your terminal , or idle of choice.

3-Once the terminal is open, find the location of the downloaded folder. Example: Users/Arasay/Downloads/AI_P2

3-Once you directory and terminal reaches the file AI_P2, your idle will access the whole folder.

4-I run this command line by typing g++ -std=c++17 -Wall main.cpp to compile the cpp program and make sure there are no errors.

5-After it compiles I type ./a.out

6-The program should start prompting the user for start and end goal, the excluded points which you can choose more than one just separated by spaces, example (B1 C3).
after that user should just simply play along with the program.
